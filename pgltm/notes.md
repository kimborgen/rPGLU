The sglu, renamed to PGLU, demonstrated the power of short-term modelling trough neuron potential gating signals, but it lacks the 
longer term modelling ability of LSTM and thus falls short 1-5% on modelling benchmarks. This model, a recurrent Potential-Gated and Long-Term Memory model shall aim to rectify this by adding some form of long-term memory to the PGLU.
